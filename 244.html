<h2>Errata</h2>

<h4>Page 2</h4>
<p>
There should be a footnote accompanying Figure 1-1:<br>
JavaWorld publicly apologized for the biased wording of the survey. Please 
read <a href = "http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-1998/jw-08-pollresults.html">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-1998/jw-08-pollresults.html</a> for additional details.

The results of the timing loop performance program are more varied across 
platforms then I was led to believe. JVMs, JITs, HotSpot, etc. have 
considerably different results then the hard and fast rule of always count 
down. For instance, on Solaris with JDK 1.3 and HotSpot, counting down is 
actually four times slower. (At least from one user's account.)
</p>
<p>
According to Jack Shirazi in the Java Performance Tuning from O'Reilly:
"Comparison to 0 is faster than comparisons to most other numbers. The VM 
has optimizations for comparisons to the integers -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
So rewriting loops to make the test comparison against 0 may be faster."
For the best results, check your platform specifically and consider adding 
an outer loop to the test program to time the loops multiple times.

<h4>In Listing 2-1, 9th line of code</h4>

<p>There is an "em" dash as the 4th character from end of line. It needs to be
a "--"  (double minus sign / two characters)</p>

<h4>page 13, fourth line from the bottom</h4>

<p>
String names = new String[3];<br />
should be:
</p>
<p>
String names[] = new String[3];
</p>

<h4>Page 18</h4>
<p>
In the first sentence of the last paragraph, it says "For 
multidimensional arrays, you would just use an extra set of parenthesis...". 
It should say "an extra set of curly braces." 
</p>

<h4>In Table 3-1, 3rd row from bottom, last column</h4>

<p>DefaultStyleDocument should be DefaultStyledDocument</p>

<h4>Page 47</h4>
<p>
In the code sample at the bottom of the page, the parameter passed 
to the process method should be i.next() not e.next(). 
</p>
 
<h4>Page 78</h4>
<p>
In table 5-1, the description of the elements method is incorrect. 
The elements() method allows all of the VALUES to be visited not the keys. 
</p>
 
<h4>Page 79</h4>
<p>
Same problem in table 5-2, the elements method enumerates the 
values not the keys 
</p>
 

<h4>Page 102, 4th to 7th line</h4>
<p>
bytes[3] = (byte)((1 & 0xFF000000) &gt; 24);<br>
bytes[2] = (byte)((1 & 0x00FF0000) &gt; 16);<br>
bytes[1] = (byte)((1 & 0x0000FF00) &gt; 8);<br>
bytes[0] = (byte)((1 & 0x000000FF) &gt; 0);<br>
</p>
<p>
This should be:
</p>
<p>
bytes[3] = (byte)((1 & 0xFF000000) &gt;&gt; 24);<br>
bytes[2] = (byte)((1 & 0x00FF0000) &gt;&gt; 16);<br>
bytes[1] = (byte)((1 & 0x0000FF00) &gt;&gt; 8);<br>
bytes[0] = (byte)((1 & 0x000000FF) &gt;&gt; 0);<br>
</p>


<h4>8th line of listing 5-5 in page 102</h4>
<p>
c = (char)((x > 4) & 0xf);
</p>
This should be

c = (char)((x >> 4) & 0xf);


<h4>Page 110</h4>
<p>
Third paragraph from the bottom, should read "For the NAND (not and) operation" rather than "For the NAND (not add) operation"
</p>

<h4>Page 147</h4>
<p>In the code sample at the top of the page, the variable name anotherSet is used (3 lines from the bottom) and then I print out a variable called set3...set3 should be anotherSet</p>

<h4>Page 166</h4>
<p>At the end of the "Removing Another Collection" section. "removeAll() returns true if the underlying LIST changes" (instead of "set")</p>

<h4>Page 209</h4>
<p>
The Top Right corner of page has [(H1L)]. This should be Maps I think to coincide with the other pages in chapter.
</p>

<h4>Page 217</h4>
<p>About 1/3 of the way down the page, you I a set using the variable name "set" and in the very next line use "set2". set2.addAll(...) should be set.addAll(...)</p>

<h4>Page 229</h4>
<p>In the "Singleton Collections" section, I say "act similar to the specialized methods for creating empty collections."<br>
"creating" should be "returning"</p>

<h4>Page 236</h4>
<p>Top paragraph, below note, 3rd line add "will be negative and" to make the returned value will be negative and can be used</p>

<h4>Page 251</h4>
<p>First code snippet: I create an array called "array2", but then pass "array" to the sort method <br>
Change 2nd line to be 
Arrays.sort(array2, 3, 7);</p>

<h4>Page 376</h4>
<p>In table A-15 the description of the elements() method is incorrect. <br>
The elements() method allows all of the VALUES to be visited not the keys.</p>

<h4>Page 379</h4>
<p>Same problem in table A-19, the elements() method enumerates the values not the keys</p>
